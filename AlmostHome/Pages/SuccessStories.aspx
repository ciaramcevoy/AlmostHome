                                Hi Karen,
                            Wanted to give you an update on Lola.
                            She is so loved by us all, quite honestly is one of the family. Aidan, our youngest couldn't resist her new jumper for Halloween!! First time we've put clothing on her and she loves it!!!!
                            Still working our way through the housetraining, having a few accidents but that's all fine. We're getting there!!!
                            Hope all is well with you, many thanks again for everything.
                            Lola sends her love.
                            </p>

                                Hi Karen, 
                                A little update of muffin, she has settled really well after her second night and doesn't mind our cat, he's not too fussed on her though haha. Muffin does have a massive bed but prefers mine.

                                Hi Karen, 
                                Hope yourself and family are well. Marilyn was at the groomers tonight and looks like a wee pup all fluffy and adorable. Marilyn was 5kilos and is now 6.19kilos. She loves her walks round divas mountain and last night we let her of the lead for first time and she ran off but came straight back. We love her so much.

                                Hi Karen 
                                Just a quick update on Jasper - we've had him two weeks and it feels like he has always been here. He is really growing in confidence. Such a great, loving dog. 

                                There's one of him on the beach at the North Coast and he loves to swim. One on Slemish at the weekend. And one with his new best friend - Amber! 

                                He did have a an abscess come up on his neck - which gave us a scare, but the vet drained it and no problems since!  

                                Hope all is good with you

                                Izzy is doing great. She's an amazing girl. An absolute character and extremely bright. She's really well behaved and was very easy to train. She can be a bit of a diva but it's funny. She'll bark at you if she wants a walk and can open every door in the house, including the back food if she's left outside for too long! She loves watching TV, particularly David Attenborough and Countryfile. She immediately sits up when she hears Adam's voice because she knows she might see Boo the dog!! 

                                She gets on brilliantly with our older girl, Jess. I have discovered a new world of greyhound and lurcher lovers....... They stop me when I'm walking her, admire her and ask millions of questions! I can understand why people are so devoted to these gentle, intelligent breeds. Best doggie ever and we love her very, very much.

                                Thank you so much for introducing us

                                Morning Karen, 

                                The vet visit went well and the stitches came out fine, Marilyn was great throughout. 

                                Marilyn is getting better now at sleeping right through and loves all her walks outside.

                                We now have a dog walker in the days me and Nat are out of the house for long periods. Here is the pic we love most of Marilyn loving outside.

                                Havanna is such a very different girl! She rules our house lol! She sleeps in the bed with us and the amount of attention she gets in UNREAL! She would even hit us to get attention!! I can't even tell you in words how much she has changed!
