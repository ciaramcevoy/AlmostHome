    <p>Almost Home are an animal rescue based in Moria in Northern Ireland. We have been open from 2013. We aim to help the unwanted, neglected and abandoned and give them a chance of happiness. Almost Home Animal Rescue is entirely self-funded and is run by a very small team of dedicated volunteers. All money raised for Almost Home Animal Rescue goes directly towards the feeding and caring of the animals, this also includes hefty veterinary bills for those that have been mistreated or become ill. Every penny you give goes directly to helping these animals and saving more. Almost home cater for many types of animals such as dogs, cats, turtles, farm animals and other small pets.</p>
